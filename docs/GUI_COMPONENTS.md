# GUI component inventory (initial, unverified)

Classify each item as built-in, styled built-in, or custom only after a Slint prototype and API review.

| Component | Expected approach | Key concerns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transport play/pause/cue/sync buttons | styled/custom control | keyboard, MIDI state, active/disabled feedback |
| Deck status and track metadata | styled controls | responsive layout, truncation |
| Multicolor scrolling waveform | custom renderer | smooth rendering, zoom, beat grid, cue markers, low CPU/GPU usage |
| Overview waveform | custom renderer | seek, progress and markers |
| Jog wheel / platter | custom control | touch/mouse drag, angular feedback, latency |
| Pitch fader | custom/styled control | precise mapping, fine adjustments |
| Volume fader and crossfader | custom/styled control | accurate input and visual state |
| EQ/filter/gain knobs | custom control | rotary input, value scales, reset gestures |
| Level/VU meters | custom control | animation, clipping indication |
| Hot cue pads | custom/styled control | color/state mapping, controller feedback |
| Loop controls | styled/custom control | loop length and active state |
| Mixer channel strips | composite control | reuse, layout and signal indicators |
| Browser, crates and track table | built-in/styled with custom behavior | virtualization, sorting, keyboard navigation |
| Audio device and settings panels | mostly built-in/styled | accessibility and validation |
| Notifications, tooltips and dialogs | mostly built-in/styled | consistency and focus management |

## Definition of done per control
- State model and input events specified
- Mouse, keyboard and controller behavior defined
- Theme and visual reference approved
- Performance tested where animated
- Automated tests and visual review completed

Reference visuals must be used for design comparison, not copied proprietary assets.

## Local overview checkpoint (2026-10-24)

The overview now uses custom Slint rectangles and a TouchArea, backed by up to 256 real PCM peak bins per deck. Headless tests cover peaks, pointer/time mapping, accessible percentage input, marker geometry at two widths and independent load/reload state. The detailed scrolling/multicolor waveform remains open. This does not finalize the framework or satisfy the visual/performance definition of done above; no visual review or rendering profile has been completed.

## Detail-view checkpoint (2026-10-24)

A second Slint peak-envelope view follows each deck's playhead and exposes 2–32-second zoom buttons. Its local click range and playhead are headless-tested; unchanged viewports reuse their model. The full-track overview remains separate. Frequency colors/beatgrid and rendering/visual qualification remain open; this is not a completed framework-evaluation gate.
